          I'm currently studying Computing Science at Simon Fraser University,
          diving deep into the world of technology. Coding is my passion, and I
          find joy in solving complex problems using elegant solutions. My
          academic journey has given me a solid understanding of algorithms,
          data structures, and software design. I'm also gaining real-world
          experience as a Software Developer Intern at
          <a class = "link"; href="https://www.geotab.com/" target="_blank">Geotab</a>. Working
          with a talented team, I'm involved in projects that use the latest
          technologies to improve fleet management and vehicle tracking.
